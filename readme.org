** Layout
I manage my configuraiton files with
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]], usually by calling the ~@install~
script from the root of this repository: ~./category/@install~.
** XMonad
XMonad configuration is [[https://github.com/azahi/xmonad-config][here]]. It's
no longer actively maintained because I switched to
[[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]].
** Screenshots
A small history of my desktop alterations can be found here
[[https://v.teknik.io/v/kqFNt][here]]. (Recent stuff is a the bottom)
